HEART DISEASE PREDICTION
This project analyzes factors contributing to heart disease using machine learning models. It applies various classification techniques and statistical analyses to predict the likelihood of heart disease based on patient health indicators.
Project Overview

This project undertakes exploratory data analysis (EDA), visualization, and machine learning to identify key factors influencing heart disease. The goal is to create an accurate model to predict heart disease risk and analyze contributing health metrics.

Dataset

The project uses the Heart Disease Health Indicators Dataset from Kaggle, containing various patient health indicators like blood pressure, cholesterol levels, BMI, smoking habits, and more.
Features and Steps

	1.	Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and transforming data for model compatibility.
	2.	Exploratory Data Analysis: Visualization with heatmaps, univariate, and multivariate analyses.
	3.	Feature Engineering: Creating and selecting the most influential features.
	4.	Class Imbalance Handling: Techniques like oversampling/undersampling.
	5.	Model Training and Evaluation: Training various models and using accuracy metrics, confusion matrices, and classification reports.

Models Used

	•	Logistic Regression
	•	Decision Tree Classifier
	•	Random Forest Classifier
	•	Support Vector Machine (SVM)
	•	K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
	•	Gradient Boosting
	•	XGBoost
	•	AdaBoost
	•	Naive Bayes
	•	MLP Neural Network

Each model is evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to identify the most effective predictor of heart disease.

Results

The project presents the accuracy and classification metrics for each model, highlighting the model with the best predictive performance. Heatmaps and visualizations depict correlation strengths and feature importance.
